I made sure in this implementation to adapt the theme for all (it's in progress) languages AND markdown preview.\nTo do so, I've copied the code from the theme [One-dark](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-syntax), which the best atom-maintained theme in my opinion and updated the colors.\n\nThe license has been copied from that of one dark.\n\n## What does it look like ?\n\n![JavaScript example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quilicicf/monokai-complete-syntax/master/doc/screenshot.png)\n\n## Installation\n\n- Open a terminal\n- Run `apm install monokai-complete-syntax`\n- Open Atom\n- Open settings (ctrl+,)\n- In _Themes_ choose _Monokai complete_ in the syntax theme drop-down\n\n## Contributions/feedback\n\nJust follow [the guide](https://github.com/quilicicf/Docs/blob/master/contribution/main.md)\n\nThank you for helping out!\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/quilicicf/monokai-complete-syntax/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/quilicicf/monokai-complete-syntax#readme","_id":"monokai-complete-syntax@2.0.1","_shasum":"6b509b2a807b000efe69ff32b3c4b22b73a9fbd0","_resolved":"file:../d-117715-35409-12m3212.2dllx9wwmi/package.tgz","_from":"../d-117715-35409-12m3212.2dllx9wwmi/package.tgz"}
